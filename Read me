The Python Level 1 folder contains the lectures on python. Any one can use this to learn the basic concepts or to 
refresh what you have learned. I've created this in Google Colab. You can also access this on Google Colab so that, you can try
out there itself.
Everyone is welcome to add more concepts to this repository that related to python.
Happy Learning
